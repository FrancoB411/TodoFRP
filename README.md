# TodoFRP

This program is split into three distinct parts: Model, Update, and Display.
The Todo file puts all of that together.

#### Model.elm:
Representations of the todo list application.

#### Update.elm:
Describes how to update the todo list based on user's actions

#### Display.elm:
How to display our model on screen. Also describes interactive UI
elements and makes them available for updating the model.

#### Todo.elm:
Bring together the model, update, and display to create the todo list
